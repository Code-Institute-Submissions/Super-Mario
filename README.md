## The Design
___
#### I got the first inspiration when I start to design this website from [Nintendo](https://www.nintendo.com/nes-classic/) classics website, I actually try to make a restyling of it with my personal touch, but I wasn't happy enough after the first view, so I decide to make my own design.

#### I decide to use colors that reminds the user the original NES console.

* The body is a combination of #E4001F and #FFF;
* For the Navbar I actually choose the same grey that Nintendo used #AEAEB5;
* I decide to replace Navbar colour #AEAEB5 with  rgb(107, 136, 254) to be consistent with the warp pipe zone theme I choose;

## Wireframes

I have decided to use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)  to create wireframes for my website. First I created a basic wireframe for desktop and later on for tablet and mobile. 
The website will be easy to navigate by using the navigation bar or by scrolling down the page.

You can find my wireframes below:

## Navbar

### Plan 

As the majority of my their mobile users my approach was mobile first responsive, the idea it was to make mobile users comfortable while exploring the website and add some animation on the navbar link that recall super mario videogames. Each section has a read me button which redirect to external links.

### Implementation

I made links in navbar with animation effect when hover on it, to divide sections I used diagonal box width title and super mario effect.

### Test 

When I first tested for mobile resolution I noticed that while hovering on the nav links the animation didn't behave like what I expected, the pipe image actually flip over and the result was poor in terms of UI.

I decide to wrap the list elements inside another div then I added display flex for mobile min-widht.

### Result

Animation is now working as planned with nice and smooth transition. On mobile screen is now easy to view and navigate.

### Videogame section

### Plan

My plan is to create a videogame section with text content to give an overview of the game history and a button where the user can click and being redirect to an external video link. 

### Implementation

I created a section with two text content, a carousel where the user can explore different videogames version, and one button to see the video.

### Test 

I have tried  to navigate on mobile and tablet, resolution was good but I wasn't happy in terms of UI. Users can be confused with the call to action button they may aspect to read more content rather than redirect to youtube video.

I decide to display the video directly in the section so no need to click another button but the video can be played directly in the website, underneath the first text content I placed the carousel  than the video iframe as a last element.

### Result

Videogame section is now working as planned, is more easy to read and intuitive for the UI point of view.

### Contact Form

### Plan

After visiting the website user is able to get in contact via email simple to make a request or receiving addition info.

### Implementation

I created responsive contact form with required inputs and with a fancy background image.

### Test 

Form work as expected in terms of responsiveness for all the screen size but the background is not in line with the website design and not consistent with the design I had in mind.

I searched online for an image of super mario warp zone and replace the previous one.

### Result

Now the contact section is solid and consistent with the rest of the design from the top to the bottom.

Testing HTML with  [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), first results:
* Warning
    * heading section lacks heading
    * section section lacks heading

* Errors
    * form action " " cannot be empty
    * end tag for emelemt /div which is not open

* Fixes
    * changed heading and section to div
    * Removed action in the form attribute as no needed for this project
    * Removed end tag for for the div which was not opened

Testing CSS with [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), no errors found.

#### Responsiveness
* Bootstrap implemented throughout the project to ensure mobile first responsive and   tested with devtools and Lambdatest.

* **Result** was successful and as to be expected.

#### Design
* **Implementation** got inspiration from the official Mario website of Nintendo but not following any particular pattern, I decide to use diagonal separator for each section and using fonts and images that reminds me the game also to give sense of familiarity for those who knows the game.

* **Results** I'm quite happy as I made something original but consistent with the videogame character.

### Contact Form
* **Implementation** I got the contact form from the Bootstrap site and made few changes to meet my needs, Form validation was implemented to ensure that user put values to any field before sending the email.

* **Results** Contact form works as expected.
* **Verdict** Validation works, test passed.
